## What i have learned

- With this project i learned how to set up a simple CRUD app plus getting more familiar with modules.
- A better understanding about event delegation and how to use it.
- Learning to add external libraries like date-fns using npm that helped me set up my date section functionality.
- A chance to use different kind of array methods like filter, findIndex, map, sort and methods like element.closest() or node.contains()
- Learning to add and use data-set properties so i could save custom attributes.
